# Nature Conservancy Kaggle
## Computer Vision - Experimentation Code
Code written while exploring sklearn, keras, opencv and other related modules.

Will group code together as much as I can to help others get started.

This code is intended to be open source, an easy way to get started with submitting your own ideas for this kaggle competition.

Planning to re-purpose my exploration code for others on the forums in Jupyter Notebook form. But this is an intermediate location to track thoughts, progress, etc...
